# Noob-Board

A community board for posting and commenting on questions, share ideas, and help each other out. Post your problem, comment a solution, and favourite helpful posts.

Visitors can view all posts and comments. However registration is required to be able to create new posts, to comment on other posts and to mark helpful posts as favourites.

Registered users can see a list of all their original posts and favourites. Email notifications are sent out when someone comments on their posts.

Trello was used for project planning.

The app is hosted on Heroku. The database is an add-on on Heroku called "mLab MongoDB".
